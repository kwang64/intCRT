\title{Compute Individual Survival Curve under UTT Policy Intervention}
\usage{
get_surv(baseline.i, tau.i, beta, x.i)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline.i}{List. A list of baseline survival components for stratum \code{i}, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{survival}: a data frame with columns \code{time} and \code{surv}.
\item \code{density}: (not used in this function, but typically part of the baseline).
\item \code{hazard}: (not used here, but included in the baseline list).
}}

\item{tau.i}{Numeric. Internal time point indicating the implementation of the UTT policy.}

\item{beta}{Numeric vector. Coefficient vector with elements corresponding to:
\itemize{
\item \code{beta[1]}: pre-UTT intervention effect
\item \code{beta[2]}: main effect of UTT
\item \code{beta[3]}: interaction effect of UTT with intervention assignment
}}

\item{x.i}{Numeric. Indicator variable for individual intervention assignment (e.g., 0 = control, 1 = treated).}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{time}{The time points from the baseline survival curve.}
\item{surv}{The adjusted individual survival probabilities at each time point.}
}
}
\description{
Returns the survival curve for an individual in a given stratum, adjusting for the effect of a
Universal Test-and-Treat (UTT) policy and intervention assignment.
}
\details{
The survival function is modified based on the individual's intervention assignment and the
timing of the UTT policy. Prior to \code{tau.i}, survival probabilities are scaled by \code{exp(beta[1] * x.i)}.
Post-\code{tau.i}, an interaction model accounts for both the UTT main and interaction effects.

\examples{
# Simulated baseline curve
base <- return_exp_baseline(maxT = 10, lambda0 = 0.1, alpha = 0)
get_surv(base, tau.i = 5, beta = c(0.3, -0.2, 0.1), x.i = 1)
