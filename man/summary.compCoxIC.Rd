\title{Summarize a Fitted Composite Cox Proportional Hazards Model}
\usage{
\method{summary}{compCoxIC}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{List. Model output from \code{composite_coxIC()} containing estimated coefficients, variance,
variance method, data attributes, and call information.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{x} after printing the summary.
}
\description{
Prints a summary of the fitted Cox proportional hazards model returned by \code{composite_coxIC()},
including data attributes, regression coefficients, hazard ratios, standard errors, z-statistics,
p-values, and significance stars.
}
\details{
The summary prints the total number of subjects, clusters, strata, and events used in the model.
Regression coefficients and their standard errors are displayed alongside hazard ratios
(\eqn{\exp(\beta)}) with associated z-scores and p-values. Significance levels are annotated as
\code{***} (p < 0.001), \code{**} (p < 0.01), \code{*} (p < 0.05), \code{.} (p < 0.1), or blank otherwise.
If variance estimates are unavailable, related statistics are shown as NA.

Additionally, the method used for variance estimation is described (profile composite likelihood or bootstrap).
