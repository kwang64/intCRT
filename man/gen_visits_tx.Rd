\title{Generate Covariate-Dependent Monitoring Schedule}
\usage{
gen_visits_tx(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric. Treatment assignment indicator (1 = treatment, 0 = control).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of visit times (in the same time unit as your survival model, e.g., weeks).
Treatment group participants receive ~15 random visits spaced between 12 and 24 units,
plus 4 regularly scheduled visits (around week 52, 104, 156, 208).
Control group participants only receive the 4 regularly scheduled visits.
}
\description{
Simulates a vector of internal study visit times based on treatment assignment.
Participants in the treatment group receive more frequent monitoring, while
control group participants receive only scheduled quarterly (annual) visits.
}
\examples{
# Simulate visit times for a treated and untreated participant:
gen_visits_tx(1)  # More intensive monitoring
gen_visits_tx(0)  # Standard quarterly visits
