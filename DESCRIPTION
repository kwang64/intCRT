Description: 
    Provides functions for fitting marginal Cox proportional hazards models 
    to clustered interval-censored time-to-event data using the composite likelihood 
    framework introduced in Cook et al. (2023). The package supports estimation 
    of regression coefficients, stratum-specific baseline hazards, and robust 
    variance estimation. Utilities for simulating clustered interval-censored 
    datasets modeled after the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) 
    are also included.
